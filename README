This is a distributed precompute hashing system for WPA/WPA2's PBKDF2.  Most of the original work was done some time ago.  It looks like last modifications before creating the git repository were in December of 2009.

Some of this code may not work as expected as I have not run it in quite some time and we are on quite a different version of GCC now than when it was written.  There is a usage statement that shows some of the basics, but this program has two modes: client and server.  A database is created, SSID's are added, passwords are added, then a server is started on the database.  Clients connect to the server which hands out the current SSID, then hands out blocks of passwords for the clients to compute and return to the server.  The server stores these computed PMKs in the database for later lookup.
